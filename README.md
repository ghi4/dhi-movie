This project is about a movie catalog that I done on my final submission from [Dicoding](https://www.dicoding.com/) in class [Menjadi Android Developer Expert](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/165) which is the last class from [Android Developer Learning Path](https://www.dicoding.com/learningpaths/7).
I'm so happy because I received 5 stars on this submission. I hope this project can be useful for you as a learning reference.
